F2U Artwork
===========
---
Even if it's exclusive to any of my other content only, I try to make most of my SFW media available for free usage.

Asking is not required! Don't feel obligated to ask just to use any of the images I post here, because you don't need to do that! As long as you credit me in your material--which is all I ask for--and that you follow the TOS below, you have my full permission to utilize any images I create (and definitely show me what you make of it as well)!

# Free Artwork Made for Others

On my ***[Artfol 🔗↗](https://artfol.co/focalflare)*** and ***[DeviantArt 🔗↗](https://deviantart.com/focalflare)*** social platforms, which you may have already seen, I have developed logos, banners, and cover art, and other media that I occasionally make. Those were created for free for other people. Absolutely free, indeed. A list of the media I can and cannot do is provided below.

[![Portable Storage](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/a1cae8f2-1709-44fe-9884-7fb3b18449cf/dfcbbgq-5f57017b-f7ee-492d-978a-24a181e85619.png/v1/fill/w_1192,h_670,q_70,strp/portable_storage_by_focalflare_dfcbbgq-pre.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9NzIwIiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvYTFjYWU4ZjItMTcwOS00NGZlLTk4ODQtN2ZiM2IxODQ0OWNmXC9kZmNiYmdxLTVmNTcwMTdiLWY3ZWUtNDkyZC05NzhhLTI0YTE4MWU4NTYxOS5wbmciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9MTI4MCJ9XV0sImF1ZCI6WyJ1cm46c2VydmljZTppbWFnZS5vcGVyYXRpb25zIl19.slmyXs1KYkSpUl5Pi-d3OXbv3b9d4gm-zvtTxLfu7yA "Portable Storage")](https://www.deviantart.com/focalflare/art/Portable-Storage-927676106)

## What I Can Do

**I will gladly make mediums such as the following:**
* **Strictly SFW mediums**
* ***[Cover art 🔗↗](https://soundcloud.com/focalflareaudio/sets/art-for-tracks-i-did)***
* Logos
* Thumbnails
* Banners
* Panels
* Renders
* Minimalistic designs
* EFT's (extremely fungible tokens, direct opposite of NFT's (non-fungible tokens))
* Fictional firearms (Firearms will be posted on my Artfol to prevent drowning out my DeviantArt.)

## What I Can't/Won't Do

* **NSFW/suggestive/n\*de media.** I mean, come on. If I don't wanna see it, I don't wanna make it. NSFW even of any partial percent is still NSFW in my book, so please don't try to talk yourself out of it or excuse yourself to get me to look at or make it. This includes actual g\*re on its own (unless it's fake g\*re like pastelg\*re or candyg\*re).
* **NFT's (non-fungible tokens).** Neither will these be made, nor will they ever be tolerated. These are zero-tolerance not to be made of any of my material.
* **Complex designs, especially in a certain style.** There's little to no chance that I'll actually make it however you want it to turn out. See the TOS for Artwork Made just for You section below. It's much more of an issue if it has to be done by a set deadline that doesn't allow me enough time to make it.
* **Fan art.** Obviously I still make fan art of different media, but not for requests. The eligibility for the fan art to be made for either an individual or any medium from them is determined by what I think about the medium (just like listening to a track and determining if I like it or not before thinking about remixing it) This is not a copyright/DMCA matter, but fan art requests are not open.

However, that's just about a small breakdown of things I can and can't/won't create because I have a lot more up my sleeve. I can't provide a full list of things I can and can't/won't create as it'd be a very tentative list of things. You can view most of my artwork on my DeviantArt and Artfol profiles if you're still curious about what I can and can't create. My images are displayed here and on my Artfol in different folders—so-called "galleries"—on both platforms.

## TOS for Artwork Made just for You
Even though I'm lenient enough to allow you to do anything with whatever I create for you, I want to make sure that the usage for it doesn't become a messy anarchy to deal with. Therefore, I ask you to follow these terms I set:
- Please be aware that I might not be able to--depending on your request--create artwork for you in the style you have requested. As a result, I will try my best to create it in my style or a similar style that I am capable of. There will be no creation of NSFW or NFT material.
- Even though other forms of thanking me are all appreciated, the only thing I ask in exchange for you using the media I make is credit as it's more than enough! You can mention "credit to Focal Flare for [used media here]" in the description of whatever, but please link back to the original media from me that you've used.
- Understandably, you may not like the current direction of the art being made or the final version of it--which I've had things like these happen before and it's bound to happen now and in the future. Regardless, please don't hijack the artwork (or in this case, add your own changes to the art without discussing them with me first).
    - If you disagree with anything within the current version of the art and need it changed, please let me know immediately and I'll try my best to make the appropriate adjustments. Otherwise, I'll assume that it's done. This condition is enforced since all of my artwork is entirely SFW and anti-NFT, and I don't want anyone to add anything that would violate my TOS.
- I have the right to reject your request if it's either anything in the "What I Can't/Won't Do" section or what I consider as an example of said things listed in it.

### ***[Creative Commons 🔗↗](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)***

Forgot to mention, rules suck, and nobody reads any TOS either (admittedly like me, for example), but we have to enforce and follow them in some way.

All of my original media--unless it's my take on an existing media--is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. This means that you are free to do the following:
- Share the original material in any format.
- Adapt upon the material.

However, by doing so, you agree to the following:
- Attribution [BY]: Give appropriate credit and don't plagiarize (claim as your own). (Violation: Warn > Blacklist)
- NonCommercial [NC]: Avoid utilizing the material to your advantage. This includes selling the materials for physical currency in the form of prints and other products, as well as cryptocurrency in the form of NFT's (please do not sell my artwork as NFT's). (Violation: Zero-tolerance blacklist)
- Derivatives (depending on the media/medium)
    - ShareAlike [SA]: Regardless of the medium used for your adaptation, use the same CC-BY-NC-SA4 license. (Violation: Inform)
    - NoDerivatives [ND]: Don't make any adaptions of said medium. (Violation: Inform)
- No additional restrictions: Please don't apply further restrictions on top of the existing ones! I will add them wherever/whenever I see fit. (Violation: Inform)

### General Terms

[![](https://media1.tenor.com/m/0PD9TuyZLn4AAAAd/spongebob-how-many-times-do-we-need-to-teach-you.gif)](https://tenor.com/view/spongebob-how-many-times-do-we-need-to-teach-you-old-man-slow-thick-gif-12272188)

Again, I'm lenient for people to make use of my art without me restricting them of what they can do with it, but regardless of whether you're using anything I made from or not from a request, I urge you to follow the terms above and the following below:

> Please be patient. I am not obligated to get something done within a time frame shorter than the amount of time I'm allowed to work on your request.
* I tend to work slowly on art at my own pace, but the speed at which I make it depends on three things: the art currently being made, my current mood, and things IRL that block my path. With that, I ask you to not rush me with things.
* If you want art from me, then you'd want art that actually looks somewhat decent rather than art that looks like it was rushed, and good art is never rushed! Sometimes I speedrun art either to give myself a challenge for fun or to get it done in time for an assignment, but I prefer that I work in my "zen mode" than in my "stress mode".

> When requesting or processing a request from anyone, I have the right to cancel or deny your request for any valid reason above.
* Progress checks and revision requests are things I am to be expected of being asked for--so please ask me for these things in case I forget! But being rude or disrespectful while I currently make art for you and constantly rushing me after asking you to be respectful and not rush me will warrant me canceling your request and denying any future requests you have.
* If whatever kind of medium you want me to make art for you under falls in any of the can't/won't list (which I will add more things to that and the can/will list), I will deny your request unless you have any other medium in mind you want me to make art for you under, which I will carefully look into and decide if that looks like something I'd be proficient enough in making art under.
* If your request is something that requires me to spend a lot of time on it to make it good and it needs to be done within such a short time frame for me to not work on it, then sadly I will have to cancel/deny your request unless you have a back-up plan for the art to be done on a later date. I know you wouldn't like there to not be any art for something you have up-and-coming, but I'd rather have you come up with some sort of plan in this case than promote something up-and-coming without anything in-hand. I solely apologize if we couldn't figure something out in time, but please do not put me in the lead of sorting these things out on my own!

> Have a solid idea on what you want before making a request.
* It's okay to have an erratic mind and be tentative like me. Regardless, please do not request art if you are unsure on what you're wanting to be made. This reduces the amount of times you sporadically switch things up and the amount of revisions I need to make!
* If you need to, go through my galleries so you can have some idea on what you want!
    * Oh yeah, make sure to drop a follow for ya boi
        * This is completely optional as it doesn't cost a penny.

> The use of my images in artificial intelligence datasets/databases is prohibited.
* Look, I know I use AI (artificial intelligence) as well, but I only use it as a tool for assistance, referencing, or inspiration to make my own art of any kind made with NI (natural intelligence), **which would be me, the person writing this entire TOS**. Either way, as a human, I don't think that I need to say this anymore times than this one time within this journal: ***Don't use any of my art for your own AI models.***

* You are free to mess with my images and use them as "starting prompts" for any AI-generation service that allows you to insert images to get an image back, but when doing so, you are only—***and only***—allowed to use the output AI-generated images(*) you get for inspiration or referencing, not for passing off as your own. Plagiarism isn't a joke, and passing these images off as your own is basically the equivalent of you passing off art made by other humans and myself as your own.
    * **Also, if you think I should call these "AI "art"" because it's "easier to say", then you're actually insane because AI-generated images are not and will never be "art" as there's no human activity involved in the making of the images, so calling it such is literal "clickbait".**

# How to Request
You can reach out to me for requests by either sending me a message on DeviantArt through chat DM's (chat is preferred over notes or through my social media:

> Discord: focalflare
* I will most likely respond to messages sent to me on Discord. Messages sent to me will have a slight chance of appearing as message requests since the feature works selectively (it's very sh\*tty as well).

> Twitter: @/OfficialRF2 
* Twitter (I'm not calling it "X") is planning on limiting messages per day for basic users, so I wouldn't rely on this method if this happens. Messages sent to me will be sent as message requests unless I follow you.

> Bluesky: @/officialff.bsky.social
* Bluesky may still be rolling out their messaging feature to everyone, so you might not be able to see this feature in your current version unless you refresh your tab or update your client app. Messages sent to me will be sent as message requests unless I follow you.

> Artfol: FocalFlare 
* At this time, there's no way to send messages via the web version of Artfol, so you might have to either send a message through the app itself or comment on any of the recent images I've uploaded.

> MeWe: itzzfocalflare 
* Gonna be dead-honest, I look at MeWe on a blue moon, but I have messages open if you really need to message me but you don't have any of the following above (and if this of all platforms to message me on isn't feasable then...oh well 🤷🏾‍♂️). Messages sent to me will be sent as message requests unless I add you.

For DeviantArt, I prefer the chat feature over notes because messages are sent in real-time, unlike notes. Plus, notes become spammy if you don't know how to reply to an already-existing note you sent me. For instance, one of my watchers here (not saying who) sent me multiple messages as separate notes and almost flooded my entire notes inbox with them.
