F2U Artwork
===========
---
Even if it's exclusive to any of my other content only, I try to make most of my SFW media available for free usage.

Asking is not required! Don't feel obligated to ask just to use any of the images I post here, because you don't need to do that! As long as you credit me in your material--which is all I ask for--and that you follow the TOS below, you have my full permission to utilize any images I create (and definitely show me what you make of it as well)!

# Free Artwork Made for Others

On my [Artfol ðŸ”—â†—](https://artfol.co/focalflare) and [DeviantArt ðŸ”—â†—](https://deviantart.com/focalflare) social platforms, which you may have already seen, I have developed logos, banners, and cover art, and other media that I occasionally make. Those were created for free for other people. Absolutely free, indeed. A list of the media I can and cannot do is provided below.

## What I Can Do (Image: Portable Storage)

**I will gladly make mediums such as the following:**
* **Strictly SFW mediums**
* [Cover art ðŸ”—â†—](https://soundcloud.com/focalflareaudio/sets/art-for-tracks-i-did)
* Logos
* Thumbnails
* Banners
* Panels
* Renders
* Minimalistic designs
* EFT's (extremely fungible tokens, direct opposite of NFT's (non-fungible tokens))
* Fictional firearms (Firearms will be posted on my Artfol to prevent drowning out my DeviantArt.)

## What I Can't/Won't Do

* **NSFW/suggestive/n\*de media.** I mean, come on. If I don't wanna see it, I don't wanna make it. NSFW even of any partial percent is still NSFW in my book, so please don't try to talk yourself out of it or excuse yourself to get me to look at or make it. This includes actual g\*re on its own (unless it's fake g\*re like pastelg\*re or candyg*re).
* NFT's (non-fungible tokens). Neither will these be made, nor will they ever be tolerated. These are zero-tolerance not to be made of any of my material.
* **Complex designs, especially in a certain style.** There's little to no chance that I'll actually make it however you want it to turn out. See the TOS for Artwork Made just for You section below. It's much more of an issue if it has to be done by a set deadline that doesn't allow me enough time to make it.
* **Fan art.** Obviously I still make fan art of different media, but not for requests. The eligibility for the fan art to be made for either an individual or any medium from them is determined by what I think about the medium (just like listening to a track and determining if I like it or not before thinking about remixing it) This is not a copyright/DMCA matter, but fan art requests are not open.

However, that's just about a small breakdown of things I can and can't/won't create because I have a lot more up my sleeve. I can't provide a full list of things I can and can't/won't create as it'd be a very tentative list of things.
