F2U Artwork
===========
---
Even if it's exclusive to any of my other content only, I try to make most of my SFW media available for free usage.

Asking is not required! Don't feel obligated to ask just to use any of the images I post here, because you don't need to do that! As long as you credit me in your material--which is all I ask for--and that you follow the TOS below, you have my full permission to utilize any images I create (and definitely show me what you make of it as well)!

# Free Artwork Made for Others

On my Artfol and DeviantArt sites (https://artfol.co/focalflare and https://deviantart.com/focalflare), which you may have already seen, I have developed logos, banners, and cover art, and other media that I occasionally make. Those were created for free for other people. Absolutely free, indeed. A list of the media I can and cannot do is provided below.

# What I Can Do (Image: Portable Storage)
I will gladly make mediums such as the following:

Strictly SFW mediums

[Cover art â†—](https://soundcloud.com/focalflareaudio/sets/art-for-tracks-i-did)

Logos

Thumbnails

Banners

Panels

Renders

Minimalistic designs

EFT's (extremely fungible tokens, direct opposite of NFT's (non-fungible tokens))

Fictional firearms (Firearms will be posted on my Artfol to prevent drowning out my DeviantArt, and shout-out to @MikePrivalis and @IzzyLuv-BGGF for the watchers from their design competitions.)
