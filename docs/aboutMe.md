### Introduction

> Guys TF is up, itzzFocalFlare, Focal, Flare, Tommy Wolfox which isn't my real/legal name, or whatever the `F U C K` you wanna call me.

### About Me

> I'm Afro-Irish Native American  (yes I'm black and Irish so excuse my word usage) (living in the US) and I'm 21 as of this message (age = current year - 2002). I'm a cisgender male so my pronouns are he/him. However, I won't snap at you if you don't know my gender or pronouns, so when in doubt, refer to me either by my names or they/them. My sexual orientations are LGBTQ+ ally and asexual. I know that might not make sense to some of yall, but I have a tweet explaining it.

# What I Do
> I'm an SFW multimedia content creator (no nu#### or s## media), so I make almost all sorts of media under the broad SFW category.
