# Markdown for About Me & TOS

This repository consists of all the resources used for this website, made using MD (markdown) and hosted via Docsify using Docsify-this. Each section and piece of the website corresponds to each file shown either on the left of or above this MD file.

Alternatively, you can go to any of these files yourself as what's shown here mirrors (almost) everything on the website:

  * [Home](home.md)
  * [About Me](aboutMe.md)
  * [Art TOS](tos.md)

This website was made possible with Docsify and Docsify-this. Therefore, it's completely open-source, so you can use it as a "template" for making your own MD-based website if you're also using Docsify!

Access the link to the website from the **Releases** section on the right or wherever it may be according to your device.
